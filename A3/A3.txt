My code uses the factory design pattern with which it creates Armour objects of int quality.
Had I more time I would have used the decorator pattern to work with attributes such as strength, intelligence,
etc., in which one can virtually have an infinite value. The factory design principle's use is justified because
many different kinds of armours can be brought into the game and for such a scenario, the factory principle suits right.
